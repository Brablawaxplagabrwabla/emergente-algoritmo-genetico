# N Queen Problem (Genetic Algorithm Approach)

Small implementation of a genetic algorithm employing two types of mutation OX and MIX to solve the N-Queen problem. The implementation can efficiently handle boards of up to 300 queens and has been employed (albeit with some waiting) to solve boards of 1000+ queens.

## Installation

The code isn't compiled, you can import it into Netbeans or Eclipse (you may have to compress it into a .zip file first) then you can either build it or run it inside the IDE. It has a simple console interface which will guide you with the required data input and then output the results.
